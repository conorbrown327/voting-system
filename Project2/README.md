# Team 21 Voting System

## Important notes:
```
When testing this, we realized that if you are running this from the  command line, then you have to pass the file path instead of just the file name when running the program. For example, since the driver class is in src/election/, in order to run from the command line, one would use:

../election.files/[fileName]

as the filename when running from the command line. We ran this all in Eclipse, so if there is access to that, it will likely make your life a
lot easier since Eclipse is rather strange when it comes to file paths it seems. We just wanted to make this explicitly clear, as we have put so many hours into this project and we know it works, and we just want to make sure you have everything you need to run it.

Also, some testing files are in a separate location from the others. Some tests are in src/election/tests, while some (OPLTest.java, TiebreakTest.java, IRElectionUnitTest.java, and InputHelperTest.java) are in the src/election folder. There is a method to this madness, but we apologize for any inconvenience nonetheless.
